Another use case is digital signatures, where the owner will encrypt metadata about the message using the private key. Anyone with the public key can decrypt such a signature that only the private key could have created.\n",

The \"owner\" of this set of such integers can share $e$ and $n$ so that others can encrypt messages that only she can read. Traditionally, such a person is refered to as Alice, and the person to whom she shares this \"public\" information is called Bob.\n",

For each $m\\in M$ he calculates $c = m^e\\,mod\\,n$ and assembles $C = [c_0,\\cdots c_n]$ and sends $C$ to Alice. Alice then uses $d$, which she has kept to herself in all the world, to calculate from each $c\\in C$, $m = c^d\\,mod\\,n$. She then assembles $M=[m_0\\cdots m_n]$ and reversing the previously agreed conversion from message to numbers, retrieves the secret message.\n",
